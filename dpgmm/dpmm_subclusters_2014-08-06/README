# Cog Sci 2019: Comparing unsupervised speech learning directly to human performance in speech perception

**This repository contains large binary files stored as Git LFS.** Install Git LFS (https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage) before cloning.

This repository contains everything needed to replicate the human experiment (stimuli, experimental scripts), the model training (DPGMM code, requires MATLAB; corpora available on request), and the analysis (trained models, data, data analysis code), from the paper,

> **Millet, Juliette, Jurov, Nika, and Dunbar, Ewan.** *Comparing unsupervised speech learning directly to human performance in speech perception.* To appear in the proceedings of Cog Sci 2019, Montreal.

The present code is forked from

The original README for this code is pasted below.

=====

The following code is provided as is.  It was used in:

[1] J. Chang and J. W. Fisher II, "Parallel Sampling of DP Mixtures
    Models using Sub-Cluster Splits". Neural Information Processing
    Systems (NIPS 2013), Lake Tahoe, NV, USA, Dec 2013.

Any papers using this code should cite [1] accordingly.

The software requires the following libraries:
1) GNU Scientific Library: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
2) Eigen library: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

The software has been tested under Matlab R2012a and gcc 4.6.3.

After unpacking the file and installing the required libraries (add the lib folder where they are to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
start Matlab and run the following:

>> cd <root dir>/Gaussian
>> compile_MEX
>> cd <root dir>/Multinomial
>> compile_MEX

If no errors are reported, you can then run demo.m in the Gaussian
or Multinomial directories.

If errors are reported, you may need to debug a little:
1) Check the installation of GSL and Eigen.
2) Check to make sure your compiler supports OpenMP
3) If you are not running a Linux OS, try commenting out the line with
     "DFLAGS = [DFLAGS ' -DUSESTOPWATCH '];"
   This will disable timing, but still allow the algorithms to run.

If all else fails, you can try to email me at jchang7@csail.mit.edu.
I will try to help if I can.
